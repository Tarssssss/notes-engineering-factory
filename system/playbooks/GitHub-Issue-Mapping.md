# GitHub Issue Mapping Rules

## Rule

- Create GitHub Issues for tasks with `P0` or `P1` only.
- Keep P2 tasks in markdown backlog unless manually promoted.

## Required Issue Fields

- Source note path
- Original TODO text
- Priority
- Due date
- DoD checklist

## Reference Linking

- From Issue -> link note path and task ID.
- From `Tasks.md` evidence column -> link Issue URL after creation.
